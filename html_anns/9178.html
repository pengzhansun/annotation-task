                <p><i><u><strong>Definition</strong></u></i>: An intention description that expresses the need for an object's <i><u><strong>uncommon functionality</strong></u></i> instead of the primary affordance or function.</p>

Priority for selection: 1. The sentence must express an uncommon intention (required); 2. The sentence is related to the displayed picture (optional).</p>
                <p>2. If necessary, revise the selected sentence. If none of the candidate sentences meet the criteria, please write a new sentence that conveys an uncommon intention and <i><u><strong>does NOT</strong></u></i> describe the primary affordance or function <i><u><strong>holding liquids</strong></u></i>.</p>
